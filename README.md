# Telegram NLP bot example

A telegram bot to detect a programming question and return a related tag and answer (NLP class project, 
Trained on 100k questions. Uses Chatterbot for non-programming chit chat and word embeddings created with StarSpace.)

This could be used as a boilerplate to create a more advanced bot trained on a domain specific Q/A set.

Run using:

```
python3 main_bot.py --token=YOUR_TOKEN
```
